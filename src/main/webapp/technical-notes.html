<h2>Namespaces</h2>
<p>
Namespace prefixes are used extensively in the UI and proprietary search interfaces.
Representing a long URI in short nsPrefix:localName not only shortens ID's but
makes it more readable and easily usable in e.g. XML/HTML ID's with only minor tweek (replace ':' with e.g. '-').
Used NS prefixes are the same all around semantic.hri.fi and can be 
queried using SPARQL: 
<pre><a href="sparql.html?query=SELECT%20%3Fns%20%3Fprefix%20WHERE%20{%20%3Fns%20%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fdata.mysema.com%2Fschemas%2Fmeta%23nsPrefix%3E%20%3Fprefix%20}">SELECT ?ns ?prefix WHERE { ?ns &lt;http://data.mysema.com/schemas/meta#nsPrefix&gt; ?prefix }</a></pre>
</p>

<h2>Faceted search</h2>
<p>
Faceted search is built using multiple (small) SPARQL queries in back-end.
Depending on parameters, queries are optimized differently, e.g. binding values
directly in graph patterns or in filter clause. Examples of used SPARQL queries 
can be acquired from <a href="search.html">Faceted Search</a> "Show SPARQL" -link. 
Note that in terms of faceted search the dataset of an item is just another dimension, 
but in Scovo it is modelled using diffent predicate (scv:dataset instead of scv:dimension).
</p>
<p>
Another optimization is that when there's only one or two facet restrictions
only available facet values are queried from dataset metadata using proprietary 
stat:datasetDimension predicate. 
</p>
<p>
When there's three or more restrictions, queries are targetted to actual statistical items.
First we query for available distinct datasets, then available distinct dimension values, 
then actual items (single valued properties) with limit and offset and lastly for each item it's 
dimensions. In this case making multiple small and relatively simple queries is more efficient 
than one large one.
</p>
<p>
For paging we always query for one extra item over the given limit. If this extra row exists, 
there is items for at least one another page and there is no need for count-query.  
</p>
<p>
For query building we use <a href="http://source.mysema.com/display/rdfbean/RDFBean">RDFBean's RDF Queries</a>.
It makes building dynamic queries programmatically more reliable and easier than via string
concatenation.
</p>

<h2>Map Demo </h2>

<p>
The Map Demo uses Google Maps to visualize area polygons of the Finnish capital region. The polygon data is provided
in JSON form to the Google Maps script and additional area specific metadata such as example statistics and DBpedia descriptions
are loaded lazily via Ajax/HTTP.
</p>
<p>
The polygon visualization uses the Google Maps JavaScript library and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/polygonzo/">Polygonzo</a>
for fast polygon rendering. Polygonzo processes the polygon data via JSON objects in <a href="http://geojson.org/">GeoJSON</a> form. 
</p>

<h2>SPARQL queries</h2>

<p>SPARQL queryies can be executed both via the query form and the SPARQL HTTP endpoint. The SPARQL HTTP endpoint is SPARQL 1.0 compliant with 
the exception that limit and offset have to be provided via limit and offset HTTP parameters. When LIMIT and/or OFFSET are declared in the query, 
the query processing might fail.</p>
